Version: 1.0 2022
Implementation in Python 3.8, the codes for the Prototype of Vehicle Speed Smart Radar for to sell this project to the Insurance Brokers in Ecuador, for use this prototype in the process of investigation of accidents and catastrophic situations in our avenues or streets. 
We are using our background developing modules and Web Apps for Brokers in Ecuador and they are very interested in this type of Smart radar.  

What is the version 1.0:
+ We have a Dataset with thousands of images bout the signals than we want to detect in the next part of the Algorithm usin IA. 
+ Pre-Train of the CNN model (Convolutional Neuronal Network) of that Dataset for to obtain a pattern for our prototype.
+ Construct a first prototype for to test the App in real situations or simulated for to adjust our CNN model for to obtain a precisition grather or iqual to 95%. More closer to 100% is ideal but in the practice 90 or more percent is confiable.
+ Present the prototype to potential clients. 
+ Make Digital marketing of our product.

It will be available soon!!!
